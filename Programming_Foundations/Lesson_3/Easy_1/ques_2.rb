Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. => attached to a method ! makes it destructive, ? makes it a boolean
And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:
1. what is != and where should you use it? => not equal, uses in a conditional statement 

2. put ! before something, like !user_name => not operator, not user_name

3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!  => bang operator, makes a method destructive, not all methods accept a bang operator

4. put ? before something => ternary operator

5. put ? after something => boolean value of something

6. put !! before something, like !!user_name => turns something into a booleans
